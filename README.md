# Welcome to my GitHub webpage

Collections of various micro-projects done to learn new topics.
Written in my free time. I focus on foundations.
Current topics:

	- Numerical Linear Algebra. Basic operations in C, C++, CUDA
	- Write graphics on the screen, using C and SDL
	- Statistics: test for randomness
 	- .bat scripting, too coordinate programs under Windows machines


I don't have any particular plan, and I program here just for fun
to complement the topics that I use in my profession.

But, I can see a potential merge of the topics above:

	- write a solver for Stochastic Differential Equations
 	- in parallized CUDA
   	- whose solution is dynamically plotted on screen
