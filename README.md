# Welcome to my GitHub webpage

This website is a collections of various micro-projects I am developing in my spare time.
I am driven by my passion for Numerical Mathematics, in particular Stochastic and Monte Carlo simulations.
The following repositories are currently available:

 - IntroLin: collection of ideas about Numerical Linear Algebra
 - TODO

See you!
